    <h2>Project</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>1. Indian Sign Language Detection using Deep Learning</h3>
    <p>Developed an Indian Sign Language (ISL) detection system to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text. The system uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to process real-time video input. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and others by enabling gesture-based interaction.
 <br>
<strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, CNN, NumPy,NLP.

<h3>2.Real Time Speech Based AI for Interview and tutor</h3>
<p>Developed a real-time speech-based AI system designed to assist users with interview preparation and learning. The system captures spoken input, converts speech to text, analyzes responses using AI and NLP techniques, and provides intelligent feedback in real time. It acts as a virtual interview coach and tutor by asking questions, evaluating answers, and offering improvements to enhance communication and technical skills.
<br>
<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>Python, Speech Recognition, NLP, Machine Learning, Text-to-Speech (TTS), Flask
